 <Portfolio>
 Description
My motivation for creating a portfolio is to have some place to share and show my future projects to clients and companies. Although this was my first time creating something like this, I do see the immediate need for one as I progress through the course. My portfolio solves the problem of me not having an online presence. I learned that CSS is a very useful tool in designing my webpages to my liking. I enjoy the element of creativity and freedom it gives users.


## Installation

The steps I took from beginning to end to complete my current portfolio were to start in the index and lay the foundation by creating an html and then proceeding to make a "head" property. In the "head" property, I put the title of the document and then I added a body element and listed every section I wanted on my webpage along with a navbar. I then added a "hire me" button and then I proceeded to start my next 4 sections (About Me, Portfolio, Services and Contact Me.) using the "section id" property. A couple of reoccurring things I used were "img src" to put photos in. In the 'Contact' section, I added text boxes for users to message me personally. In the CSS side, I focused heavily on getting my images and text to fix on my page by utilizing flex-wrap and flex-direction. Over some of the buttons, I added a hover element so that whenever someone drags their cursor over one it changes color. I messed around a lot with margins, padding, height, width, justify-content and align-items to name a few to get my images and boxes in the location I wanted them and to allow them to move with the page. I eventually made phone and tablet css files to help ensure people could use my webpage on the mobile devices.

## Usage
If someone were to refer to my github, I have screenshots showing each section of my portfolio. I made sure my portfolio was responsive and if someone were to click on any particular section , it will lead them to that section. I had one issue of getting my "portfolio" tab to match up exactly like everything else but it still takes the user to that aforementioned section.
